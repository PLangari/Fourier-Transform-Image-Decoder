# Fast Fourier Transform Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithms in Python for image decoding and cleaning. The focus is on the Cooley-Tukey FFT method, with applications in image noise reduction and compression.

## Features
- **DFT Implementation**: Includes both a naive and an optimized FFT approach.
- **Image Operations**: Uses FFT to perform denoising and compression on images.
- **Multidimensional Transform**: Handles 2-dimensional FFTs for image processing.
- **Visualization**: Plots the Fourier transform of images on a logarithmic scale.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.5+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`
